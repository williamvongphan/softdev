how-to :: Import Python Modules
---
## Overview
Python modules are other files containing 
Python code. You can import them into your
current file to use the code in them.

### Estimated Time Cost: 0.3 hours

### Prerequisites:

- Python understanding
- Basic understanding of how Python looks for modules

1. In a Python file of your choice, create a function or class (Python classes may be discussed later in this course).
2. Save the file as `your_module.py` (or any other name you want) in the same directory.
3. In the Python file where you want to use the entire module (with functions and classes nested within), import the module using `import your_module`.
4. Or instead of importing the whole module, you can import only the function or class you want using `from your_module import your_function_or_class`.
5. Profit
